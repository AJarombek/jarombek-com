                    first arrived at St. Lawrence in Canton, New York I wasn't sure what I wanted 
                    to study.  Luckily, St. Lawrence is a liberal arts college that encourages 
                    students to explore all the different subject areas before picking a major.  
                    One of the classes I tried my first semester was CS101: Intro to Computer 
                    Science.  I only selected CS101 because it was a class without any essays, and 
                    I really hated writing (which is funny considering I now write software 
                    development articles every week).  The class taught me basic imperative 
                    programming concepts in Python.`,

                    semester for my first two years of college.  At the end of my Sophomore year 
                    I declared as a computer science major and started taking multiple programming 
                    classes each semester.  Still, I didn't do any computer science research or 
                    programming outside of class assignments.  That changed my Junior spring.`,
