                    first arrived, I wasn't sure what I wanted 
                    to study.  Luckily, St. Lawrence University is a liberal arts college that 
                    encourages students to explore different subject areas before picking a major.  
                    I decided to try CS101: Intro to Computer Science during my first semester.  At 
                    first I only enjoyed CS101 because there were no essays, and 
                    I really hated writing (which is funny considering I now write software 
                    development articles every week).  By the end of the semester I really enjoyed 
                    the challenge of writing code.  The class taught me basic imperative 
                    programming concepts in Python.`,

                    I declared as a computer science major and started taking multiple programming 
                    classes each semester.  However, I still didn't research computer science
